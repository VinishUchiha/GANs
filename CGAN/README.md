# Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(cGAN)

The conditional generative adversarial network, or cGAN for short, is a type of GAN that involves
the conditional generation of images by a generator model. Image generation can be conditional
on a class label, if available, allowing the targeted generated of images of a given type. In this
notebook, you will discover how to develop a conditional generative adversarial network for the
targeted generation of items of clothing
