## CycleGAN

**CycleGAN** is a type of **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** for cross
domain transfer tasks, such as changing the style of an image, turning
paintings into photos, and vice versa, photo enhancement, changing the
season of a photo, and many more. CycleGANs were introduced by `Jun-Yan
Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros` in a paper entitled:
`Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial
Networks.`
