## 3D GAN

**3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D-GANs)** is a variant of GANs, just like **StackGANs**, **CycleGANs**, and **Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks ( SRGANs)**. Similar to a vanilla GAN, it has a generator and a discriminator model. Both of the networks use 3D convolutional layers, instead of using 2D convolutions. If provided with enough data, it can learn to generate 3D shapes with good visual quality. 

3D shape generation is typically a complex problem, due to the complexities involved in processing 3D images. A **3D-GAN** is a solution that can generate realistic and varied 3D shapes and was introduced by`Jiajun Wu, Chengkai Zhang, Tianfan Xue,`and others in the paper titled Learning a Probabilistic Latent Space of
Object Shapes via 3D Generative-Adversarial Modeling.
