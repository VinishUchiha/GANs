## 3D GAN

**3D-GAN** is a GAN architecture for 3D shape generation. 3D shape generation is typically a complex problem, due to the complexities involved in processing 3D images. A 3D-GAN is a solution that can generate realistic and varied 3D shapes and was introduced by`Jiajun Wu, Chengkai Zhang, Tianfan Xue,`and others in the paper titled Learning a Probabilistic Latent Space of
Object Shapes via 3D Generative-Adversarial Modeling.
