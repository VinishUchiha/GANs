## 3D GAN

**3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D-GANs)** is a variant of GANs, just like **StackGANs**, **CycleGANs**, and **Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks ( SRGANs)**. Similar to a vanilla GAN, it has a generator and a discriminator model. Both of the networks use 3D convolutional layers, instead of using 2D convolutions. If provided with enough data, it can learn to generate 3D shapes with good visual quality.
